Assignment design: 

1. requestpid(): get the actual pid number from system (more for practice purpose)

2. int allocate_pid(): assign pid into selected location
 use -1 to indicate the failure of assigning pid, otherwise just simply return the value of pseudo-pid.

3. int allocate_map(): get the memory location
 use -1 and 1 to indicate the succeed and failure of location creation. 

4. void release_pid():
 use to delete or reset the memory location to make availability.

5. void *threadfunc(void *arg): create threads to request pseudo-pid, wait for a while then release the pid

6. Proper output is needed.
